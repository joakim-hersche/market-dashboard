**Health Score (0–100)** — a composite score measuring how well-diversified your portfolio is. It is *not* a measure of \
investment quality — a score of 40 means "concentrated", not "bad." Click "How is this calculated?" to see the formula \
with your actual numbers. The score has four components:

- **Diversification (35%)** — how many different sectors and geographic regions you cover. More spread = higher score.
- **Concentration (30%)** — how evenly your money is distributed. One stock at 70% scores low; ten stocks at 10% each scores high. \
Uses the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI), the same formula economists use to measure market concentration.
- **Correlation (20%)** — whether your stocks move independently or all rise and fall together. \
Lower average correlation = better diversification benefit.
- **Stability (15%)** — how much your portfolio value swings day-to-day compared to the market. Lower volatility = higher score.

**Key Findings** — plain-language observations about your portfolio. Red cards flag high-risk patterns (e.g., heavy \
concentration in one stock), amber cards flag areas to watch (e.g., sector imbalance), and green cards highlight strengths \
(e.g., good geographic spread). These are factual observations, not recommendations.

**Sector Exposure** — which industries your money is spread across, with bars showing portfolio weight per sector. \
Sectors with 0% exposure are listed at the bottom.

**Detailed Metrics** — the full analytics table (volatility, Sharpe ratio, beta, P/E, etc.) and correlation heatmap \
from the old Risk tab. Collapsed by default so the narrative findings get attention first.

**Rebalancing Calculator** — set target weights and a deposit amount to see buy-only suggestions. \
This is a calculation tool, not a recommendation.

with no filtering or ranking. Click any headline to read the full article.""").classes("text-sm").style(f"color:{TEXT_SECONDARY}")

Where available, sector median values are shown for context (e.g., "Above sector median of 28.1").

"Detailed Metrics" section of the Portfolio Health tab:

- **Volatility** — how much the price swings day to day, expressed as a yearly percentage. Higher = more unpredictable.
- **Worst Drop (Max Drawdown)** — the biggest peak-to-trough fall in the past year.
- **Return/Risk Score (Sharpe Ratio)** — how much return you earn per unit of risk. Uses the actual 10-year \
government bond yield for your currency as the risk-free rate (not a fixed assumption). Above 1 is good, above 2 is excellent.
- **Downside Return/Risk (Sortino Ratio)** — like the Sharpe ratio but only penalises downside volatility. \
A stock that swings up a lot but rarely drops will have a higher Sortino than Sharpe. Above 1 is good, above 2 is excellent.
- **Market Sensitivity (Beta)** — how much the stock moves relative to your local market benchmark \
(S&P 500 for USD, SMI for CHF, Euro Stoxx 50 for EUR, FTSE 100 for GBP, OMX 30 for SEK).
- **Correlation** — whether two stocks tend to go up and down together (close to 1.0) or move independently (close to 0).
- **P/E Ratio** — how many years of current earnings you are paying for.
- **Dividend Yield** — the annual dividend payment as a percentage of the stock price.""").classes("text-sm").style(f"color:{TEXT_SECONDARY}")

earned in 10-year government bonds — the standard proxy for a risk-free return:

| EUR | German 10-Year Bund |
| GBP | UK 10-Year Gilt |
| CHF | Swiss 10-Year Confederation Bond |

**Why the German Bund for EUR?** Germany has the highest credit rating in the eurozone, and the Bund is the \
industry-standard risk-free benchmark for euro-denominated assets. Other eurozone countries (Italy, Spain, etc.) \
carry additional credit risk, which means their higher yields are not truly "risk-free."

The line compounds daily yields into a cumulative return, rebased to 100 like all other lines on the chart. \
A flat or gently rising line means rates were low; a steeper climb means bonds were paying more.

SEK data is fetched from central bank APIs with no key required.""").classes("text-sm").style(f"color:{TEXT_SECONDARY}")

of tail risk (CVaR).

If your portfolio dot is on the curve, your allocation is optimal. If it is below the curve, you could get more \
return for the same risk, or less risk for the same return, by adjusting your weights.

Individual stock dots show where each holding sits on its own. Stocks above the curve are outperforming on a \
risk-adjusted basis; stocks below are underperforming.

portfolios that minimise tail risk (the worst-case losses) rather than just average volatility.""").classes("text-sm").style(f"color:{TEXT_SECONDARY}")

behaviour — how much it typically moves each day — but shuffles the order of good and bad days randomly. \
The result is a fan of possible futures:

- The **dark band** is where 50% of the replays ended up — the most likely zone.
- The **light band** covers 80% of replays — a wider range of plausible outcomes.
- The **dashed line** is the median — exactly half of the replays were above, half below.

If the fan is wide, there is a lot of uncertainty. If it is narrow, the stock has been relatively stable historically.

**Portfolio Outlook** adds two extra metrics:
- **VaR (Value at Risk) 95%** — in the worst 5% of replays, the portfolio lost at least this much. \
Think of it as a loss threshold that only 5% of simulated outcomes exceeded.
- **CVaR (Expected Shortfall) 95%** — the average loss in those worst 5% of replays. Always worse than VaR; \
this is what tail risk actually costs on average.

how many ended above your buy price?""").classes("text-sm").style(f"color:{TEXT_SECONDARY}")

are independent from one day to the next. These assumptions are often wrong for real stocks:

- **Jarque-Bera: Fail** means the stock has fatter tails than a bell curve — extreme days (crashes or rallies) \
happen more often than the model expects. The fan chart will understate how bad a bad day can really be.
- **Ljung-Box: Fail** means today's return is correlated with recent days — there is momentum or mean-reversion \
that the model ignores.
- **QQ Plot** — if the dots follow the red line, the bell-curve assumption holds. Where the dots curve away from \
the line, the real distribution has heavier tails.

Most individual stocks will fail the normality test. That does not make the simulation useless — it means you should \
treat the edges of the fan as optimistic. Real tail risk is likely larger than shown.""").classes("text-sm").style(f"color:{TEXT_SECONDARY}")
